# Data Analysis

Thus, we will be able to decipher from these reviews the best beers as from BeerAdvocates' users.

This will allow us to go deeper and analysis why these beers make it to the top, based on the other features present in the dataset.

Then, we will be able to do so for some unique kinds of beers, such as the weirdest ones, the ones lacking, the most polarizing ones etc. To then focus on what are the very best ones based on the reviews, the count of reviews, and the standard deviation of reviews.

Finally, we will look at what consitutes a good beer, and why is that, through a correlation matrix.
